Welcome to my portfolio.  Attached are a few of the projects that I have developed while a student in the SMU Coding Bootcamp.  These projects show my creatativity and understanding of front-end web development technologies including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and the use of APIs.

Click on any of the links on the "Projects" tab to peruse my projects.  The README files contain descriptions on how to use each application.

Hope you enjoy these projects.

Thank you.
