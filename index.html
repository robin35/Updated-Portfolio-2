                    Hi.  My name is Terra.  I am a native Texan having been born and raised here.  
                    I started my career in accounting but found I had an interest in technology while taking 
                    the information systems courses that were required by my accounting degree plan.
                    <br/><br/>
                    After I graduated, became a certified public accountant ("CPA"), and 
                    spent eight...that's right...eight long, boring years as an auditor, 
                    I decided to make a switch to the technology arena.  I became an IT Auditor, 
                    then a Systems Analyst and the rest, as they say, is history!
                    <br/><br/>
                    So here I am in the SMU Coding Bootcamp taking a leap of faith into full stack developing and learning some
                    "Lorem Ipsum" on the way...
                    <br/><br/>
                    Anyone for some "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla mollis eget turpis vel ultrices. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
                    consectetur adipiscing elit"???
                </p>
